**Valuation metrics**
===

Valuation metrics are used to determine the value of a company and its stock. Some of the commonly used valuation metrics are:

## Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:
This is the most widely used valuation metric and measures the price of a stock relative to its earnings per share (EPS). The formula for the P/E ratio is:
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share

A high P/E ratio indicates that a stock is overvalued, while a low P/E ratio indicates that a stock is undervalued.

## Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:
This metric measures the price of a stock relative to its book value (the value of the company's assets minus its liabilities). The formula for the P/B ratio is:
P/B Ratio = Stock Price / Book Value Per Share

A low P/B ratio indicates that a stock is undervalued, while a high P/B ratio indicates that a stock is overvalued.

## Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:
This metric measures the price of a stock relative to its revenue. The formula for the P/S ratio is:
P/S Ratio = Stock Price / Revenue Per Share

A high P/S ratio indicates that a stock is overvalued, while a low P/S ratio indicates that a stock is undervalued.

## Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) Ratio:
This metric measures the value of a company relative to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The formula for the EV/EBITDA ratio is:
EV/EBITDA Ratio = Enterprise Value / EBITDA

A low EV/EBITDA ratio indicates that a company is undervalued, while a high EV/EBITDA ratio indicates that a company is overvalued.

It's important to keep in mind that these are just some of the valuation metrics used to determine the value of a company and its stock, and it's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
