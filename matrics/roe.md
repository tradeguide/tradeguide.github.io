# **ROE ratio**
Return on Equity (ROE) ratio is the measure of a
company’s ability to turn equity investments into profit.
It is a ratio of the net income to the total shareholders’
equity in the company. Every industry/sector has benchmarks
for average ROE ratios.Investors can understand how
efficiently the company is turning shareholders’ equity
into profits by comparing it with the industry average.

**Example:**
```
Total shareholders’ equity = Rs.100
Income generated by the company = Rs.20
```
```
ROE ratio = Net income/Total shareholders’ equity = 20/100= **20%**
```
