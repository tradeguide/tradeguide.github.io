# **Expense ratio**
Expense ratio is the percentage of total assets
that a mutual fund charges an investor annually
for managing their money. Higher the expense ratio,
lower the returns available to the investor.




# **Fund performance vs.benchmark performance**
It is always recommended to compare the returns of a
particular fund against its benchmark index. If a fund
has consistently outperformed the benchmark index,
it’s a tick for this check box.


# **Risk level**
In the world of mutual funds, risk and returns are two
sides of the same coin. The risk should fall within your
risk appetite. If you’re an investor with a low or moderately
low-risk appetite, avoid high-risk funds.


# **Fund’s history**

The real test for a mutual fund is its long-term performance.
A good fund is one, which has generated consistent and
stable returns over a period of 5-10 years. This gives the
investors confidence that the fund can deliver returns,
not only in the bull cycle but the bear cycle as well.



# **Portfolio turnover ratio**

fund manager buys/sells securities from the fund.
High turnover leads to high transaction costs, and thus,
high expense ratio of the fund. This reduces your
net returns from the investment.

# **Fund manager**
The performance, experience, and history of the
fund manager are crucial. This increases the reliability
and confidence that your hard-earned money is in safe hands.
Moreover, the reputation and history of the fund house,
under which the scheme belongs can also be looked upon.



## How to analyze mutual fund
Analyzing a mutual fund involves evaluating various factors to assess its performance, risk profile, suitability, and overall quality. Here are some key steps and factors to consider when analyzing a mutual fund:

1. **Define your investment goals:** Clearly establish your investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and any specific requirements or preferences. This will help you determine which types of mutual funds align with your goals.

2. **Review the fund's investment objective and strategy:** Understand the fund's stated investment objective, whether it aims for growth, income, capital preservation, or a combination. Evaluate the fund's strategy and determine if it aligns with your investment goals.

3. **Assess historical performance:** Analyze the fund's historical performance over different time periods, such as 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and beyond. Compare its returns to relevant benchmarks and peer funds in the same category. Consider consistency of performance and whether it meets your expectations.

4. **Examine risk measures:** Evaluate risk factors such as volatility, beta, standard deviation, and maximum drawdown. Assess how the fund has performed during different market conditions and economic cycles. Consider the fund's risk management practices and how it aligns with your risk tolerance.

5. **Analyze expense ratio and fees:** Evaluate the fund's expense ratio, which includes management fees, administrative costs, and other expenses. Compare it to similar funds to ensure it is reasonable and competitive. Consider the impact of fees on your overall returns.

6. **Understand the fund manager**: Research the fund manager's experience, track record, and investment approach. Consider their tenure with the fund and other funds they have managed. Assess if their investment style and philosophy are aligned with your preferences.

7. **Consider fund size and liquidity:** Assess the fund's size and whether it is too large or too small for its investment strategy. Larger funds may face challenges in deploying capital effectively, while smaller funds may be more susceptible to liquidity issues.

8. **Evaluate the fund's holdings:** Review the fund's portfolio holdings to understand its asset allocation, diversification, and concentration. Assess the quality of the holdings, such as the credit quality of fixed-income securities or the growth potential of equity holdings.

9. **Review fund disclosures and documents:** Read the fund's prospectus, annual reports, and other regulatory filings to understand its investment approach, risk disclosures, and any specific considerations.

10. **Seek professional advice if needed:** If you are unsure or lack expertise in mutual fund analysis, consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific circumstances.

Remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and no single factor should be the sole basis for investment decisions. It's important to take a holistic approach and consider multiple factors in conjunction with your own investment goals and risk tolerance.
