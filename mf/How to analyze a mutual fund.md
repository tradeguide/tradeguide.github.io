# **Expense ratio**
Expense ratio is the percentage of total assets
that a mutual fund charges an investor annually
for managing their money. Higher the expense ratio,
lower the returns available to the investor.




# **Fund performance vs.benchmark performance**
It is always recommended to compare the returns of a
particular fund against its benchmark index. If a fund
has consistently outperformed the benchmark index,
it’s a tick for this check box.


# **Risk level**
In the world of mutual funds, risk and returns are two
sides of the same coin. The risk should fall within your
risk appetite. If you’re an investor with a low or moderately
low-risk appetite, avoid high-risk funds.


# **Fund’s history**

The real test for a mutual fund is its long-term performance.
A good fund is one, which has generated consistent and
stable returns over a period of 5-10 years. This gives the
investors confidence that the fund can deliver returns,
not only in the bull cycle but the bear cycle as well.



# **Portfolio turnover ratio**

fund manager buys/sells securities from the fund.
High turnover leads to high transaction costs, and thus,
high expense ratio of the fund. This reduces your
net returns from the investment.

# **Fund manager**
The performance, experience, and history of the
fund manager are crucial. This increases the reliability
and confidence that your hard-earned money is in safe hands.
Moreover, the reputation and history of the fund house,
under which the scheme belongs can also be looked upon.
