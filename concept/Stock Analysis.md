# Stock Analysis: Value & traded value

## Given Data
- **Volume of the stock**: 13,20,716 shares
- **Total traded value**: 33.73 Crore

## Calculations

### Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
The VWAP is calculated by dividing the total traded value by the volume. It represents the average price a stock traded at over a particular time period, based on both volume and price.

The VWAP represents the average price a stock traded at over a particular time period, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of a security.

This can be useful for traders to guide their buying and selling decisions. Traders may aim to trade in line with the VWAP – buying at or below the VWAP to get a lower average price, or selling at or above the VWAP to get a higher average price.

The VWAP can provide insights into the market’s activity and liquidity for this particular stock. A higher VWAP indicates a higher average price which might suggest a bullish market for the stock. Conversely, a lower VWAP might suggest a bearish market. However, these are just indicators and should not be used in isolation to make investment decisions. Always consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions.

Calculation:
```markdown
VWAP = Total traded value / Volume
     = 33.73 Crore / 13,20,716
     ≈ 255.3 (in the same currency as the total traded value)
```

### Shares Traded Per Unit of Currency
This value represents how many shares were traded for each unit of currency.

Calculation:
```markdown
Value = Volume / Total traded value
      = 13,20,716 / 33.73 Crore
      ≈ 0.000392 shares per unit of currency
```

## Interpretation

- The **VWAP** of approximately **255.3** represents the average price per share for this stock during that period.
- The value of approximately **0.000392** means that for each unit of currency, approximately 0.000392 shares were traded.

These metrics can provide insights into the market's activity and liquidity for this particular stock. However, they should not be used in isolation to make investment decisions. Always consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions.

# Investor's Handbook

## 1. Return on Equity (ROE)
**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

**Formula:**
$$
ROE = \frac{Net\ Income}{Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

**Impact:** An increasing ROE indicates that the company is generating more profit from its equity, implying effective management of shareholders' investments.

## 2. Earnings Per Share (EPS)
**Definition:** EPS is a measure of a company's profitability allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

**Formula:**
$$
EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Preferred\ Dividends}{Weighted\ Average\ Shares\ Outstanding}
$$

**Impact:** A higher EPS indicates greater profitability and can often lead to an increase in the company's stock price.

## 3. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
**Definition:** P/E ratio is a valuation ratio used by investors to assess the relative value of a company's shares.

**Formula:**
$$
P/E\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Share\ Price}{Earnings\ Per\ Share\ (EPS)}
$$

**Impact:** A lower P/E ratio could indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation.

## 4. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
**Definition:** P/B ratio measures the current share price relative to its Book Value Per Share (BVPS).

**Formula:**
$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Price\ Per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ Per\ Share}
$$

**Impact:** A lower P/B ratio could indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher P/B ratio could suggest overvaluation.

## 5. Dividend Yield
**Definition:** Dividend Yield shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.

**Formula:**
$$
Dividend\ Yield = \frac{Dividend\ per\ share}{Market\ value\ per\ share}
$$

**Impact:** A higher dividend yield indicates that an investor gets a higher return on investment.

## 6. Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio
**Definition:** D/E Ratio is used to evaluate a company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity.

**Formula:**
$$
D/E\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Total\ Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

**Impact:** A lower D/E ratio generally implies that a company has been able to fund its growth with shareholders' equity without incurring much debt.
