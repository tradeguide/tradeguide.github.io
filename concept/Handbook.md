# **Stock Handbook**

## **Volume**
In the context of stocks, **volume** refers to the number of shares of a security that are traded during a given period of time¹. It's an important indicator in technical analysis as it measures the relative significance of a market move¹. 

If a stock's volume is **1,320,716**, it means that 1,320,716 shares of that stock were traded during the specified period. This information can be useful to a buyer in several ways:

1. **Liquidity**: Higher trade volumes for a specific security means higher liquidity, better order execution, and a more active market for connecting buyers and sellers.
2. **Market Strength**: Volume can indicate market strength. Rising markets on increasing volume are typically viewed as strong and healthy².
3. **Trend Confirmation**: A rising market should see rising volume. Increasing price and decreasing volume might suggest a lack of interest and a potential reversal.

However, these are general guidelines and may not hold true in all situations. It's always recommended to use volume data in conjunction with other indicators and factors when making trading decisions.

## **Total Traded Value**
The **Total Traded Value (TTV)** in the stock market is calculated by multiplying the total volumes by the price of the share during a specific period of time¹. It's also referred to as the 'Value of Trade' of that stock³.

If the total traded value is **22.73 crore**, it means that shares worth this amount were traded during the specified period. This information can be useful to an investor in several ways:

1. **Market Activity**: A high traded value indicates a high level of activity or interest in a particular stock².
2. **Market Confidence**: Thin traded value in the overall market can give an indication that people are not confident about the trend. Whereas heavy traded value in the overall market can give an indication that people are confident about the trend whether it is bullish or bearish².
3. **Price Movements**: Large traded values can often accompany significant price movements. If a stock's price is increasing with a high traded value, this might indicate a strong upward trend¹.

However, these are general guidelines and may not hold true in all situations. It's always recommended to use total traded value data in conjunction with other indicators and factors when making investment decisions.

## **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**
The **Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)** is a trading benchmark used in technical analysis that gives the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price¹. It's calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded.

Here is the formula for VWAP:

$$
\text{VWAP} = \frac{\text{Cumulative} (\text{Typical Price} \times \text{Volume})}{\text{Cumulative Volume}}
$$

Where:
- **Typical Price** = (High price + Low price + Closing Price)/3
- **Cumulative** = total since the trading session opened¹.

This formula gives a comprehensive view of a security’s price and trading activity over a specified period. It considers both the price and the volume of trades, making it a more accurate representation of the average price than a simple arithmetic average². However, it's always recommended to use VWAP data in conjunction with other indicators and factors when making trading decisions.

>It represents the average price a stock traded at over a particular time period, based on both volume and price.

The VWAP represents the average price a stock traded at over a particular time period, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of a security.

This can be useful for traders to guide their buying and selling decisions. Traders may aim to trade in line with the VWAP – buying at or below the VWAP to get a lower average price, or selling at or above the VWAP to get a higher average price.

The VWAP can provide insights into the market’s activity and liquidity for this particular stock. A higher VWAP indicates a higher average price which might suggest a bullish market for the stock. Conversely, a lower VWAP might suggest a bearish market. However, these are just indicators and should not be used in isolation to make investment decisions. Always consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions.

Calculation:
```markdown
VWAP = Total traded value / Volume
     = 33.73 Crore / 13,20,716
     ≈ 255.3 (in the same currency as the total traded value)
```

### **Shares Traded Per Unit of Currency**
This value represents how many shares were traded for each unit of currency.

Calculation:
```markdown
Value = Volume / Total traded value
      = 13,20,716 / 33.73 Crore
      ≈ 0.000392 shares per unit of currency
```

- The **VWAP** of approximately **255.3** represents the average price per share for this stock during that period.
- The value of approximately **0.000392** means that for each unit of currency, approximately 0.000392 shares were traded.

## **Upper and Lower Circuits**

The **upper circuit** and **lower circuit** are price limits that apply to particular stocks or indices. They are types of circuit breakers present in the stock market.

- The **upper circuit** is the highest possible price that the stock can trade at on that designated day. For your stock X, this limit is **279.70**.
- The **lower circuit** is the lowest that the stock price can trade at on that day. For your stock X, this limit is **228.90**.

These circuit breakers are put in place to counter market instability due to overly emotional response to stock prices and protect investors from extreme volatility.

### **Calculation**

The upper and lower circuits for a stock are calculated based on the previous day's closing price. The percentage increase or decrease is predetermined by the stock exchange and varies from stock to stock.

Here's a simple formula to calculate the upper and lower circuit:

- **Upper Circuit = Previous Day's Closing Price + (Previous Day's Closing Price * Predetermined Percentage)**
- **Lower Circuit = Previous Day's Closing Price - (Previous Day's Closing Price * Predetermined Percentage)**

For example, if a stock has a closing price of 100 and the predetermined percentage is 10%, then:

- The upper circuit would be 100 + (100 * 10/100) = 110
- The lower circuit would be 100 - (100 * 10/100) = 90

This means that the stock price cannot rise above 110 or fall below 90 in a single trading session.

### **Example**

Given your example where the previous day's closing price `CP` is 250, the upper circuit `UC` is 279.70, and the lower circuit `LC` is 228.90, we can calculate `P` as follows:

1) For the upper circuit, we rearrange the formula to solve for `P`: 
   **P = (UC - CP) / CP**
   Substituting the given values: P = (279.70 - 250) / 250 = 0.1188 or 11.88%

2) For the lower circuit, we rearrange the formula to solve for `P`: 
   **P = (CP - LC) / CP**
   Substituting the given values: P = (250 - 228.90) / 250 = 0.0844 or 8.44%

In this case, there seems to be a discrepancy between the percentages calculated from the upper and lower circuits. This could be due to various factors such as market volatility, stock liquidity, or specific rules set by the stock exchange.

## **Market Capitalization**
Market Capitalization, often shortened to Market Cap, represents the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It's calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current market value of one share. For an investor, the Market Cap allows them to evaluate a company based on how valuable the public perceives it to be.

### Number of Outstanding Shares
The number of outstanding shares in the market can be calculated using the market capitalization and the price of one stock. The formula is:

$$\text{Number of Outstanding Shares} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization}}{\text{Price per Share}}$$

For example, if the market capitalization is `21642 crore` (or 216420000000 rupees) and the price of one stock is `255.40` rupees, the number of outstanding shares is approximately `847514933`.

## **Return on Equity (ROE)**

>**Definition:** ROE measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

**Formula:**
$$
ROE = \frac{Net\ Income}{Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

**Impact:** An increasing ROE indicates that the company is generating more profit from its equity, implying effective management of shareholders' investments.

---
The Return on Equity (ROE) is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested. In this case, an ROE of `7.39%` means that the company generates a net income of `7.39%` for every rupee invested by the shareholders.

This can be interpreted in several ways:
- If the ROE is increasing, it typically means the company is generating more profit from its equity, and management is using the shareholders' investments effectively.
- If the ROE is decreasing, it could indicate that management is not using the shareholders' investments effectively.
- If the ROE is negative, it means the company is losing money.

However, it's important to compare the ROE with companies in the same industry. A high ROE can indicate a good financial health, while a low ROE might not necessarily mean that the company is doing poorly. It could be that the company is investing heavily for future growth.

In your case, an ROE of `7.39%` would be considered decent if it's consistent with other companies in the same industry. But remember, ROE is just one aspect of a company's financial performance. Investors should consider other factors like earnings growth, debt load, market conditions etc before making investment decisions.

Return on Equity (ROE) is calculated by comparing the proportion of net income against the amount of shareholder equity³. The formula to calculate ROE is:

$$
ROE = \frac{Net\ Income}{Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

In this formula:
- **Net Income** is the bottom-line profit before common-stock dividends are paid, which is reported on a firm’s income statement.
- **Shareholders' Equity** is assets minus liabilities on a firm’s balance sheet and is the accounting value that's left for shareholders should a company settle its liabilities with its reported assets.

This ratio provides a simple metric for evaluating investment returns. By comparing a company’s ROE to the industry’s average, you can pinpoint something about the company’s competitive advantage. ROE may also provide insight into how the company management is using financing from equity to grow the business.

Please note that while calculating ROE for a stock, it's important to use the average shareholders' equity over a period of time rather than the equity value at a particular point in time⁵. This is because equity value can fluctuate within an accounting period. 

For example, if a company's net income for the year is `1000 crore` and the average shareholders' equity for that year is `5000 crore`, then:

$$
ROE = \frac{1000}{5000} = 0.20 = 20\%
$$

This means that for every rupee of shareholder equity, the company generated 20 paise in profit. 

Remember, it's important to compare ROE between companies in the same industry as it gives more accurate indications of financial efficiency.

## **Face Value**
The Face Value of a stock, also known as the Par Value, is the nominal value of a share as determined by the company at the time of issuing the stock. It's used in several financial calculations and has implications in corporate actions. However, it doesn't directly impact Market Capitalization or the current price of a unit of stock.

### Public Shareholding Requirement
The minimum percentage of shares that a company must issue in the market varies depending on the regulations of the specific country and the type of listing. In India, for example, all listed companies (other than public sector companies) are required to maintain a public shareholding of at least **25%**.

## **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
> **Definition:** EPS is a measure of a company's profitability allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.

**Formula:**
$$
EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Preferred\ Dividends}{Weighted\ Average\ Shares\ Outstanding}
$$

**Impact:** A higher EPS indicates greater profitability and can often lead to an increase in the company's stock price.

---

Earnings Per Share (EPS) is a financial ratio that measures the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. It's an important measure of a company's profitability and is often used by investors to assess financial performance.

The formula to calculate EPS is:

$$
EPS = \frac{Net\ Income - Preferred\ Dividends}{Weighted\ Average\ Shares\ Outstanding}
$$

In this formula:
- **Net Income** is the income available to all shareholders after a company's costs and expenses are accounted for.
- **Preferred Dividends** are the dividends that must be paid out to preferred shareholders before any dividends can be paid out to common shareholders.
- **Weighted Average Shares Outstanding** is the average number of shares a company has outstanding over a certain period of time. This number can change over time due to actions like stock splits or buybacks.

For example, if a company has a net income of `1000 crore`, preferred dividends of `200 crore`, and weighted average shares outstanding of `500 crore`, then:

$$
EPS = \frac{1000 - 200}{500} = 1.6
$$

This means that for every share of stock outstanding, the company earned `1.6` rupees.

EPS(TTM) refers to Earnings Per Share (Trailing Twelve Months) and is calculated using the net income of the most recent 12-month period divided by the latest number of shares outstanding.

Remember, while EPS is a useful measure, it should not be used in isolation. Investors should consider other financial ratios and indicators when making investment decisions..

---
## **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**
> **Definition:** P/E ratio is a valuation ratio used by investors to assess the relative value of a company's shares.

**Formula:**
$$
P/E\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Share\ Price}{Earnings\ Per\ Share\ (EPS)}
$$

**Impact:** A lower P/E ratio could indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation.

---

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is a valuation ratio used by investors to assess the relative value of a company's shares. It measures the current share price relative to its Earnings Per Share (EPS). The P/E ratio can help determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

The formula to calculate P/E ratio is:

$$
P/E\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Share\ Price}{Earnings\ Per\ Share\ (EPS)}
$$

or

$$
P/E\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Capitalization}{Total\ Net\ Earnings}
$$

In these formulas:
- **Market Share Price** is the current price at which the stock is trading in the market.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)** is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock.
- **Market Capitalization** is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.
- **Total Net Earnings** is the company's total earnings or net income.

For example, if a company's market share price is 255.40 rs and its EPS is 10 rs, then:

$$
P/E\ Ratio = \frac{255.40}{10} = 25.54
$$

This means that for every rupee of earnings, investors are willing to pay 25.54 rupees for the stock.

Remember, while P/E ratio is a useful measure, it should not be used in isolation. Investors should consider other financial ratios and indicators when making investment decisions. Also, it's important to compare the P/E ratio with companies in the same industry for a more accurate assessment.

## **Book Value**
The Book Value of a company is the value of the company's assets according to its balance sheet, minus its liabilities. It represents the net asset value of the company and is theoretically the amount that the shareholders would receive if the company were to be completely liquidated.

If a company has a Book Value of `130.97`, it means that the net value of the company's assets (after deducting liabilities) is `130.97` per share. This can be an important indicator for investors as it provides a concrete measure of a company's value if all its assets were to be liquidated and all liabilities settled.

The Book Value can impact several key financial ratios used by investors, including the Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio and Return on Equity (ROE). For instance, if the Book Value changes, it will directly affect the P/B ratio, which is calculated as:

$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Price\ Per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ Per\ Share}
$$

So, if the Book Value per share is `130.97` and let's say the Market Price per share is `255.40` rs (from your previous example), then:

$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{255.40}{130.97} \approx 1.95
$$

This means that for every rupee of book value, investors are willing to pay approximately `1.95` rupees for the stock.

Remember, while Book Value and related ratios like P/B ratio are useful measures, they should not be used in isolation. Investors should consider other financial ratios and indicators when making investment decisions. Also, it's important to compare these ratios with companies in the same industry for a more accurate assessment.

---
## **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio**
> **Definition:** P/B ratio measures the current share price relative to its Book Value Per Share (BVPS).

**Formula:**
$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Price\ Per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ Per\ Share}
$$

**Impact:** A lower P/B ratio could indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a higher P/B ratio could suggest overvaluation.

---

The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio is another financial ratio used by investors to assess the relative value of a company's shares. It measures the current share price relative to its Book Value Per Share (BVPS). The P/B ratio can help determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued.

The formula to calculate P/B ratio is:

$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Price\ Per\ Share}{Book\ Value\ Per\ Share}
$$

or

$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{Market\ Capitalization}{Total\ Net\ Earnings}
$$

In these formulas:
- **Market Price Per Share** is the current price at which the stock is trading in the market.
- **Book Value Per Share (BVPS)** is calculated as (Total assets - Intangible assets - Total liabilities) ÷ Number of outstanding shares.
- **Market Capitalization** is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock.
- **Total Net Earnings** is the company's total earnings or net income.

For example, if a company's market share price is `255.40` rs and its BVPS is `200` rs, then:

$$
P/B\ Ratio = \frac{255.40}{200} = 1.27
$$

This means that for every rupee of book value, investors are willing to pay `1.27 `rupees for the stock.

Remember, while P/B ratio is a useful measure, it should not be used in isolation. Investors should consider other financial ratios and indicators when making investment decisions. Also, it's important to compare the P/B ratio with companies in the same industry for a more accurate assessment.

---
## **Dividend Yield**
> **Definition:** Dividend Yield shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.

**Formula:**
$$
Dividend\ Yield = \frac{Dividend\ per\ share}{Market\ value\ per\ share}
$$

**Impact:** A higher dividend yield indicates that an investor gets a higher return on investment.

---
A **Dividend Yield** of `0.79%` means that for every `100` rupees invested in the stock, the investor receives `0.79 rupees per year` in dividends. It's a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. The formula to calculate Dividend Yield is:

$$
Dividend\ Yield = \frac{Dividend\ per\ share}{Market\ value\ per\ share}
$$

In this formula:
- **Dividend per share** is the company’s total annual dividend payment, divided by the total number of shares outstanding.
- **Market value per share** is the current share price of the company.

For example, if a company pays an annual dividend of `2 rs `per share and its current market price is 255.40 rs per share, then:

$$
Dividend\ Yield = \frac{2}{255.40} \approx 0.0078 = 0.78\%
$$

This means that for every rupee invested in the stock, the investor receives approximately 0.78 paise per year in dividends.

---

## **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio**
> **Definition:** D/E Ratio is used to evaluate a company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity.

**Formula:**
$$
D/E\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Total\ Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

**Impact:** A lower D/E ratio generally implies that a company has been able to fund its growth with shareholders' equity without incurring much debt.

---

The **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio** is a financial ratio used to evaluate a company’s financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity. It's a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations with debt rather than its own resources. The formula to calculate D/E Ratio is:

$$
D/E\ Ratio = \frac{Total\ Liabilities}{Total\ Shareholders'\ Equity}
$$

In this formula:
- **Total Liabilities** are all the money that the company owes to others.
- **Total Shareholders' Equity** is assets minus liabilities on a firm’s balance sheet and is the accounting value that's left for shareholders should a company settle its liabilities with its reported assets.

For example, if a company has total liabilities of `1000 crore` and total shareholders' equity of `5000 crore`, then:

$$
D/E\ Ratio = \frac{1000}{5000} = 0.20 = 20\%
$$

This means that for every rupee of shareholder equity, the company has 20 paise in debt.
