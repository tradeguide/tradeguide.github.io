Moving Average
=========================================

> A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price.

By calculating the moving average, the impacts of random, short-term fluctuations on the price of a stock over a specified time frame are mitigated. Simple moving averages (SMAs) use a simple arithmetic average of prices over some timespan, while exponential moving averages (EMAs) place greater weight on more recent prices than older ones over the time period.

The [moving average (MA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) is a simple [technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) tool that smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated [average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averageprice.asp). The average is taken over a specific period of time, like 10 days, 20 minutes, 30 weeks, or any time period the trader chooses. There are advantages to using a moving average in your trading, as well as options on what type of moving average to use.

Moving average strategies are also popular and can be tailored to any time frame, suiting both long-term investors and short-term traders.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

-   A moving average (MA) is a widely used technical indicator that smooths out price trends by filtering out the noise from random short-term price fluctuations.
-   The moving average helps to level the price data over a specified period by creating a constantly updated average price.
-   Moving averages can be constructed in several different ways and employ different numbers of days for the averaging interval.
-   The most common applications of moving averages are to identify trend direction and to determine support and resistance levels.
-   When asset prices cross over their moving averages, it may generate a trading signal for technical traders.
-   A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past.
-   An exponential moving average (EMA) is a weighted average that gives greater importance to the price of a stock in more recent days, making it an indicator that is more responsive to new information.
-   While moving averages are useful enough on their own, they also form the basis for other technical indicators such as the moving average convergence divergence (MACD).


## Moving Average

Why Use a Moving Average
------------------------

> A moving average is a statistic that captures the average change in a data series over time. In finance, moving averages are often used by technical analysts to keep track of price trends for specific securities. An upward trend in a moving average might signify an upswing in the price or momentum of a security, while a downward trend would be seen as a sign of decline.

A moving average helps cut down the amount of [noise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/noise.asp) on a price chart. Look at the direction of the moving average to get a basic idea of which way the price is moving. If it is angled up, the price is moving up (or was recently) overall; angled down, and the price is moving down overall; moving sideways, and the price is likely in a [range](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rangeboundtrading.asp).

A moving average can also act as support or [resistance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/resistance.asp). In an uptrend, a 50-day, 100-day, or 200-day moving average may act as a support level, as shown in the figure below. This is because the average acts like a [floor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floor.asp) (support), so the price bounces up off of it. In a [downtrend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/downtrend.asp), a moving average may act as resistance; like a ceiling, the price hits the level and then starts to drop again.

The price won't always respect the moving average in this way. The price may run through it slightly or stop and reverse prior to reaching it. 

As a general guideline, if the price is above a moving average, the trend is up. If the price is below a moving average, the trend is down. However, moving averages can have different lengths (discussed shortly), so one MA may indicate an uptrend while another MA indicates a downtrend.

Types of Moving Averages
------------------------

## Simple Moving Average
A simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a given set of values over a specified period. A set of numbers, or prices of stocks, are added together and then divided by the number of prices in the set.

A moving average can be calculated in different ways. A five-day [simple moving average (SMA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sma.asp) adds up the five most recent daily [closing prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/closingprice.asp) and divides the figure by five to create a new average each day. Each average is connected to the next, creating the singular flowing line

Charting stock prices over 50 days using a simple moving average may look like this:

## Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

The exponential moving average gives more weight to recent prices in an attempt to make them more responsive to new information. To calculate an EMA, the simple moving average (SMA) over a particular period is calculated first.

Then calculate the multiplier for weighting the EMA, known as the "smoothing factor," which typically follows the formula: [2/(selected time period + 1)]. 

For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)]= 0.0952. The smoothing factor is combined with the previous EMA to arrive at the current value. The EMA thus gives a higher weighting to recent prices, while the SMA assigns an equal weighting to all values.

Another popular type of moving average is the [exponential moving average (EMA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp). The calculation is more complex, as it applies more weighting to the most recent prices. If you plot a 50-day SMA and a 50-day EMA on the same chart, you'll notice that the EMA reacts more quickly to [price changes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-change.asp) than the SMA does, due to the additional weighting on recent price data.

Charting software and [trading platforms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trading-platform.asp) do the calculations, so no manual math is required to use a moving average.

One type of MA isn't better than another. An EMA may work better in a stock or [financial market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp) for a time, and at other times, an SMA may work better. The time frame chosen for a moving average will also play a significant role in how effective it is (regardless of type).

## Simple Moving Average (SMA) vs. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
The calculation for EMA puts more emphasis on the recent data points. Because of this, EMA is considered a weighted average calculation.

In the figure below, the number of periods used in each average is 15, but the EMA responds more quickly to the changing prices than the SMA. The EMA has a higher value when the price is rising than the SMA and it falls faster than the SMA when the price is declining. This responsiveness to price changes is the main reason why some traders prefer to use the EMA over the SMA.

## Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD)
Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price.

- Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify entry points for buying or selling.
- The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
- The signal line is a nine-period EMA of the MACD line.
- MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the default.


### What MACD Signals
The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.

Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.

### MACD Formula
```
MACD = 12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
MACD = 12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA
```

MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.


### Using MACD
MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and its baseline depends on the distance between the two EMAs.

As shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af87b241-3575-41fd-b6ff-ea1bfa0b92e4)

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.

### MACD vs. Relative Strength
The relative strength index (RSI) signals whether an instrument is considered overbought or oversold based on its recent price action. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates the average price gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top or a bottom is forming.

Unlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels. Rather, they function on a relative basis. An investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cbfa7a6-7556-45e4-9b29-238a2c10ee4a)

MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs to indicate momentum and potential trade reversals, while the RSI seeks out overbought and oversold conditions by evaluating recent price action. These indicators are often used together to give analysts a more complete technical picture.

Both measure the momentum of an instrument, but they measure different factors. The two can sometimes give contradictory results. The RSI may show a reading above 70 (overbought) for a sustained period, indicating an instrument is overextended to the buy side. In contrast, the MACD may indicate that the instrument’s buy-side momentum is still growing. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).

### Limitations of MACD
A moving average divergence can signal a possible reversal, but it will also produce numerous ‘false positives’ along the way. False positive divergences often occur when the price of an asset moves sideways in a consolidation, such as in a range or triangle pattern. A slowdown in the momentum—sideways movement or slow trending movement—of the price will cause MACD to pull away from its prior extremes and gravitate toward the zero lines even in the absence of a true reversal.

Confirmation should be sought by trend-following indicators, such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) system and its key component, the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX is designed to indicate whether a trend is in place, with a reading above 25 indicating a trend is in place (in either direction) and a reading below 20 suggesting no trend is in place.

Investors following MACD crossovers and divergences may double-check with the ADX before trusting a MACD signal. While MACD may show a bearish divergence, a check of the ADX may indicate that an uptrend is still in place. Such a doublecheck may help investors avoid the false bearish MACD trade signal and allow them to wait and see how the market develops. If MACD shows a bearish crossover and the ADX is in non-trending territory (<25) and has likely shown a peak and reversal, investors may be more willing to take the bearish trade.

### MACD Crossovers
As shown on the following chart, when MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal indicating that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when MACD rises above the signal line, the signal is bullish, suggesting that the asset's price might experience upward momentum. Crossovers are more reliable when they conform to the prevailing trend. If MACD crosses above its signal line after a brief downside correction within a longer-term uptrend, it qualifies as a bullish confirmation and the likely continuation of the uptrend.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399c5794-394b-4186-8d3e-233855b4ab37)

If MACD crosses below its signal line following a brief move higher within a longer-term downtrend, traders would consider that a bearish confirmation.

### MACD Divergence
When MACD forms highs or lows that exceed the corresponding highs and lows in the instrument’s price, it is called a divergence. A bullish divergence appears when MACD forms two rising lows that correspond with two falling lows on the price. This is often a valid bullish signal when the long-term trend is still positive.

Some traders will look for bullish divergences even when the long-term trend is negative because they can signal a change in the trend, although this technique is less reliable.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deebedfe-328a-4f8a-8c12-c27830cc92a9)

When MACD forms a series of two falling highs that correspond with two rising highs on the price, a bearish divergence has been formed. A bearish divergence that appears during a long-term bearish trend is considered confirmation that the trend is likely to continue.

Some traders will watch for bearish divergences during long-term bullish trends because they can signal weakness in the trend. However, it is not as reliable as a bearish divergence during a bearish trend.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0798eed-1953-4f1b-b921-b4df2fe5ad86)


### Example of Rapid Rises or Falls

When MACD rises or falls rapidly (the shorter-term moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average), it signals that the security is overbought or oversold and may soon retrace to normal levels. Traders often combine this analysis with the RSI or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f373c6f-599e-4ff8-9b8a-bea5a4fe1bef)

It is not uncommon for investors to use the MACD’s histogram the same way they may use the MACD itself. Positive or negative crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises or falls can be identified on the histogram. Some experience is needed before deciding which is best in any given situation because there are timing differences between signals on the MACD and its histogram.


### How Do Traders Use Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)?
Traders use MACD to identify changes in the direction or strength of a stock’s price trend. MACD can seem complicated at first glance because it relies on additional statistical concepts such as the exponential moving average (EMA), but fundamentally, MACD helps traders detect when the recent momentum in a stock’s price may be starting to fade. This can help traders decide when to enter, add to, or exit a position.

#### Is MACD a Leading Indicator or a Lagging Indicator?
MACD is a lagging indicator. The data used in MACD calculation is based on the historical price action, therefore MACD readings lag the price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator of future trend changes.

#### What Is a MACD Bullish/Bearish Divergence?
A MACD positive (or bullish) divergence is a situation in which MACD does not reach a new low, despite the price of the stock reaching a new low. This is seen as a bullish trading signal—hence, the term “positive/bullish divergence.” If the opposite scenario occurs—the stock price reaches a new high, but MACD fails to do so—this would be seen as a bearish indicator and termed “negative/bearish divergence.” In both cases, the setups suggest that the move higher/lower will not last, so investors need to look at other technical studies, like the relative strength index (RSI).

### The Bottom Line
MACD is a moving average, best used with daily data. Just as a crossover of the nine- and 14-day SMAs may generate a trading signal for some traders, a crossover of the MACD above or below its signal line may also generate a directional signal. MACD is based on EMAs with more weight placed on the most recent data, which means that it can react very quickly to changes of direction in the current price move. Crossovers of MACD lines should be noted, but confirmation should be sought from other technical signals, such as the RSI, or perhaps a few candlestick price charts. Because it is a lagging indicator, MACD argues that confirmation in subsequent price action should develop before taking the signal.


Moving Average Length
---------------------

Common moving average lengths are 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200. These lengths can be applied to any chart time frame (one minute, daily, weekly, etc.), depending on the trader's [time horizon](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timehorizon.asp). The time frame or length you choose for a moving average, also called the "look back period," can play a big role in how effective it is.1 

An MA with a short time frame will react much quicker to price changes than an MA with a long look-back period. In the figure below, the 20-day moving average more closely tracks the actual price than the 100-day moving average does.

![Image](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/h2v--Z35Urw20EYqKP9bHsjpjEE=/5496x3882/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dotdash_Final_How_to_Use_a_Moving_Average_to_Buy_Stocks_Jun_2020-03-9a5827ab870c4e4bb463b18617feb88a.jpg)


The 20-day may be of analytical benefit to a shorter-term trader since it follows the price more closely and therefore produces less lag than the longer-term moving average. A 100-day MA may be more beneficial to a longer-term trader.

Lag is the time it takes for a moving average to signal a potential [reversal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversal.asp). Recall that, as a general guideline, when the price is above a moving average, the trend is considered up. So when the price drops below that moving average, it signals a potential reversal based on that MA. A 20-day moving average will provide many more reversal signals than a 100-day moving average.

A moving average can be any length: 15, 28, 89, etc. Adjusting the moving average so it provides more accurate signals on historical data *may *help create better future signals.

Trading Strategies: Crossovers
------------------------------

Crossovers are one of the main moving average strategies. The first type is a price [crossover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossover.asp), which is when the price crosses above or below a moving average to signal a potential change in trend.2

![Image](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/DVTK5uB7SIayHWfkYtgV0la-uF0=/5542x3918/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/dotdash_Final_How_to_Use_a_Moving_Average_to_Buy_Stocks_Jun_2020-04-b9c64318755249daa936156b77f1e3c3.jpg)

Another strategy is to apply two moving averages to a chart: one longer and one shorter. When the shorter-term MA crosses above the longer-term MA, it's a [buy signal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buy-signal.asp), as it indicates that the trend is shifting up. This is known as a [golden cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp). Meanwhile, when the shorter-term MA crosses below the longer-term MA, it's a [sell signal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sell-signal.asp), as it indicates that the trend is shifting down. This is known as a [dead/death cross](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp).3

MA Disadvantages
----------------

Moving averages are calculated based on historical data and nothing about the calculation is predictive in nature. Therefore, results using moving averages can be random. At times, the market seems to respect MA support/resistance and [trade signals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-signal.asp), and at other times, it shows these indicators no respect.4

One major problem is that, if the [price action](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp) becomes choppy, the price may swing back and forth, generating multiple trend reversals or trade signals. When this occurs, it's best to step aside or utilize another indicator to help clarify the trend. The same thing can occur with MA crossovers when the MAs get "tangled up" for a period of time, triggering multiple losing trades. 

Moving averages work quite well in strong trending conditions but poorly in choppy or ranging conditions. Adjusting the time frame can remedy this problem temporarily, though at some point, these issues are likely to occur regardless of the time frame chosen for the moving average(s).

The Bottom Line
---------------

A moving average simplifies price data by smoothing it out and creating one flowing line. This makes seeing the trend easier. Exponential moving averages react quicker to price changes than simple moving averages. In some cases, this may be good, and in others, it may cause [false signals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/false-signal.asp). Moving averages with a shorter look-back period (20 days, for example) will also respond quicker to price changes than an average with a longer look-back period (200 days).

Moving average crossovers are a popular strategy for both entries and exits. MAs can also highlight areas of potential [support or resistance](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/). While this may appear predictive, moving averages are always based on historical data and simply show the average price over a certain time period.

Investing using moving average, or any technique requires an investment account with a stockbroker. Investopedia's list of the [best online brokers](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) is a great place to start your research on the broker that fits your needs the most.
